README for 'utils'

This directory holds various small tools and utilities I've created for working
with HMAX, manipulating images, computing binary classification, working with
ImageNet, and analyzing data.

  - classification/: classifiers and a function for running and scoring
    classifiers

  - ensureDir.m: a function that does nothing if a directory exists, but creates
    it otherwise. The return value is the absolute path of the directory

  - hmax/: tools for generating patch sets, C2 activations and so on. These are
    mostly wrappers and helper functions for use with HMAX-MATLAB.

  - imageNet/: tools for downloading and extracting ImageNet synsets.

  - images/: tools for manipulating matrices that represent images.

  - metrics/: tools to score/evaluate/analyze data

  - plots/: tools to plot data

  - README: this file

  - scaling/: tools to scale a series of data

  - similarity.pl: a script to calculate the semantic distance between two
    WordNet concepts.
